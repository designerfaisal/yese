                        <div class="gp">After 15 years working in the energy and environmental sustainability space including 9 years with the World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Robert realized the important opportunity energy efficiency provides to meeting the dual challenge of sustaining economic development and addressing climate change, the generational challenge of our time. During 2018, U.S, the electric power sector accounted for about 38% of U.S. primary energy consumption, and produced 33% of total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions, yet more than 65% of the electrical power generated in 2018 was never used; but wasted due to energy inefficiency (EIA, 2019). Commercial buildings sector account for 40% of total energy consumption, higher than transportation and industrial sectors (EIA, 2016) and present an important opportunity for realizing energy efficiency. It is based on this knowledge and practical experience that Robert founded YESE Energy to provide practical solutions needed by business, people and mother Earth. Robert is currently completing his PhD in Energy and Environmental Policy (ABD) at the University of Delaware and provides day today leadership as the founder and CEO of YESE Energy.</div>
